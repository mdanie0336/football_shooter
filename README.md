# Football Crash


## Descriptions
I made a game based off of football.  I use a coin to shoot lasers at the helmets and wide receievers hands, and before the lasers shoot there are being footballs shot at the player, causing the player to take damage.  There are 5 enemy ships on top of each other and the objective is to shoot down the enemies before they shoot you down(takes 5 hits to die). The trick is to dodge the enemies shots by sliding across the screen right or left, while doing this you can still shoot at them which kills them. By shooting down the opponent you're going to have to shoot down the helmet ships only once, but the widereciever hands ship you are going to need to hit three time to knock them out. Which means that one hit from the helmet ship will give you 50 points and the widereciever hands ship will give you 150 per knock. Saying that, the maximum score you can get it 1500 points.



## Instructions and Controls
1.Press "space" to begin
2.Use the arrows on they keyboard to move the player across the screen
3.Once you have began the game you will now press "space" to shoot
4.Kill the enemies ships before they shoot you down
5.Hopefully you win the game, and it will let you know by saying "You Won!"
