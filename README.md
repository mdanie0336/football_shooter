# Football Crash


## Descriptions
I made a game based off of football.  I use a coin to shoot lasers at the helmets and wide receievers hands, and before the lasers shoot there are being footballs shot at the player, causing the player to take damage.  There are 5 enemies above the player and the objective is to shoot down the enemies before they shoot you down(takes 5 hits to die). The trick is to dodge the enemies shots by sliding across the screen right or left, while doing this you can still shoot at them which kills them.




## Instructions and Controls
Press "space" to begin
Use the arrows on they keyboard to move the player across the screen
Once you have began the game you will now press "space" to shoot
Kill the enemies ships before they shoot you down
Hopefully you win the game, and it will let you know by saying "You Won!"
